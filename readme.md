# First Week
<hr>

In Day 1 I learned that system of equation is more like a system of sentence. Which gives information. Consider the following sentences

##### Sentence One

The Dog is Black
The cat is white

##### Sentence Two

The Dog is black
The Dog is black

##### Sentence Three

The Dog is black
The Dog is white

First sentence is complete because, It gives enough information. and the second sentence is Redundant because same sentence is repeating multiple times. and in the last sentence there is contradiction in that sentence. because it is saying the dog is black and also the dog is white. The dog can't have two colors at the same time (Unless it is multiple color dog üòÇ)

Complete Sentence are known to be the non-singular
Redundant and contradict sentences are known to be the singular.

<b> Quiz: Systems of sentences</b>

Given The system:

- Between the dog, the cat, and the bird, one is red
- Between the dog, and the cat, one is orange
- The Dog is black

<b>Problem 1</b>
What color is the bird?

<b>Problem 2</b>
Is the system singular?

<b>Answer:</b>
By Reading the third sentence, we get to know that the dog is black. üê∂

And By reading the second sentence <b>Between the Dog (which is black), and the cat, one is orage</b>. So we conclude the the cat is orange.

Now we have only one unknown color. Dog is black, cat is orange, So the bird must be red. 

<b> Quiz: Systems of sentences 2</b>

You go two days in a row and collect this information

- Day1: You bought an apple and a banana they cost 10$
- Day2: You bought an apple and two bananas and they cost 12$

How much each fruit cost?

When we bought an apple and a banana it cost us 10\$, 
but when we bought an apple and <b>Two Bananas</b> They cost us 12$

Notice the apple quantity is same in both sentence, but the banana quantity is changing, When we bought one banana it cost us 10\$ along with apple, but when we buy an additional banana it increments the price by two, So it means that the price of banana must be 2\$ and price of an apple must be 8$

<b>Apple: 8\$</b>
<b>Banana: 2\$</b>


<b> Quiz: Systems of sentences 3</b>

You go two days in a row, and collect this information.

- Day1: You bought an apple and a banana and they cost 10\$
- Day2: You bought two apples, and two bananas, and they cost 20\$

What's the price of each fruit? 

When we bought an apple, and a banana it cost us 10\$, but when we buy double of their quantity it cost uus 20\$. This sentence doesn't contain enough information. because there are multiple solution for that system. 

For suppose if apple is of 8\$ and banana is of 2\$, It satistfies the equation. 

If apple is of 7\$ and banana is of 3\$, it also satisfies the equation. 

If apple is of 6\$ and banana is of 4\$, It also satisfies the equation.

Means Not enough information is given in the above system. 
It is redundant and a singular.
